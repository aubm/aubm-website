      <description>Ever found yourself in a situation where you had to promote an idea that you thought it was brilliant, but your co-workers did not?
We don&#39;t always have good ideas, sometimes we poorly elaborate our instincts, and whatever we come up with doesn&#39;t pass the test of the evaluation by our pairs. If your colleagues have presented robust and logical arguments, then it&#39;s hard to defend your idea further.
The thing is, if you really care about these ideas, then it is really a shame that it would only take a solid and well established argumentation for them to be rejected.</description>
