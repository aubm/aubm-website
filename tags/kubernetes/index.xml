      <description>After a few years of daily work with Kubernetes, I decided to become a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) as well as a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA). As I&amp;rsquo;ve just taken and successfully passed the exams, I figured this was a good opportunity for a story.
My background experience My first steps with Kubernetes go back a few years ago, when I began experiencing on Google Cloud Platform and was amazed by how easy and fun it was to deploy applications on Google App Engine.</description>
