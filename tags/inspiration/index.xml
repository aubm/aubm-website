      <description>It’s been a while since I haven’t had a long debate about which communication tools we should use and how we should use them as a team. Since the global health situation won’t let us have this debate where it normally belongs - the bar - I’ll just put some thoughts here and maybe share a few unpopular opinions.
The other day I was using Slack to chat with my project manager Johana and just about when we finished our conversation, my doorbell suddenly rang.</description>

      <description>Being the best, meaning having the best technical skills. It is not a rare thing for me to meet with someone, typically a fellow developer, who will give me the impression that having figured it all out about a technology is what makes you the best match for working on a particular project.
I believe this statement is wrong and it may sound straightforward to say. But identifying what we are missing when we think like that is a bit less obvious.</description>

      <description>Ever found yourself in a situation where you had to promote an idea that you thought it was brilliant, but your co-workers did not?
We don&amp;rsquo;t always have good ideas, sometimes we poorly elaborate our instincts, and whatever we come up with doesn&amp;rsquo;t pass the test of the evaluation by our pairs. If your colleagues have presented robust and logical arguments, then it&amp;rsquo;s hard to defend your idea further.
The thing is, if you really care about these ideas, then it is really a shame that it would only take a solid and well established argumentation for them to be rejected.</description>
